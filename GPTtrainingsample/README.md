If you run the gpt_dev file using python kernel 3.12.1 in VS code. Be sure to have my input.txt file. Download the main folder GPTtrainingsample and run this code it will output new cat names generated after training itself with this list of cat names.

This is just a mini success I wanted to share with everyon in the first step to a huge learning experience!

If you open the gpt_dev file and scroll down to the very bottom. That is where the output of new unique random names will appear. (These names are not perfect yet due to the list having explanations of names after the names which I am cleaning up over time)
