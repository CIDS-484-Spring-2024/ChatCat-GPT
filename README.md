Current progress update - 02/20/2024

added the GPTtrainingsample folder. This folder has python code for kernel 3.12.1
This code takes the input.txt file which is a list of cat names. It then creates its own
list of names that are unique and different from the 15000+ names on the input.txt file

You can do this on your own computer using VS code. (you can replace the input.txt file with your own.)

Current progress update - 02/17/2024

adding a tokenizer called tiktoken. I believe this is the best option for python based AIs. I still am learning all of the requirements to make an AI run so my first milestone video may not have been very clear. My outline was still accurate but it is a ton of learning and I am unsure if I will be able to complete the project by semesters end.

I do feel confident in having a working model of some sort accomplished. Hopefully before milestone 2!

# ChatCat-GPT
This project is suppose to act like Chat-GPT. It will be targeting information retaining cats specifically.

I love cats and wanted to create or replicate something similar to Chat-GPT to further my understanding while gaining knowledge about Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT).

----------------- PROJECT ChatCat-GPT Overview -----------------

ChatCat-GPT is an artificial intelligence program that generates dialogue. Created by open-AI, this highly capable chatbot uses machine learning algorithms to process and analyze large amounts of data. This data is then used to generate responses to the users’ inquiries. This language processing program can understand human language as it is spoken and written, allowing it to understand the information it is fed, and what to spit back out. Anyone can type out a question retaining to cats, and ChatCat-GPT spits back out an easily understandable answer – in a variety of formats with precise stipulations.

For example, you can ask the question, “Why does my cat want to scratch all of my furniture?”.

One of the key features of ChatCat-GPT is its ability to generate responses like humans in real-time, based on the user’s input. It can give natural answers to questions in a conversational tone and can generate any questions that is about cats.
