# ChatCat-GPT
This project is suppose to act like Chat-GPT. It will be targeting information retaining cats specifically. 

I love cats and wanted to create or replicate something similar to Chat-GPT to further my understanding while gaining knowledge about Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT).

------------ PROJECT ChatCat-GPT Overview ------------

ChatCat-GPT is an artificial intelligence program that generates dialogue. Created by open-AI, this highly capable chatbot uses machine learning algorithms to process and analyze large amounts of data. This data is then used to generate responses to the users’ inquiries. This language processing program can understand human language as it is spoken and written, allowing it to understand the information it is fed, and what to spit back out. Anyone can type out a question retaining to cats, and ChatCat-GPT spits back out an easily understandable answer – in a variety of formats with precise stipulations.

For example, you can ask the question, “Why does my cat want to scratch all of my furniture?”. 

One of the key features of ChatCat-GPT is its ability to generate responses like humans in real-time, based on the user’s input. It can give natural answers to questions in a conversational tone and can generate any questions that is about cats.
